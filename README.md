# Football-Analytics-with-Computer-Vision

Taking inspiration from Abdullah Tarek's 'Code In a Jiffy' youtube channel, I aim to develop a football analytics system that will combine advanced AI, computer vision, and deep learning techniques to provide actionable insights into player movement and match dynamics. YOLO, a state-of-the-art object detection model, will be used to detect and track players, referees, and footballs in video footage. The model will be fine-tuned on custom datasets to enhance accuracy. Players will be classified into teams through embedding analysis techniques like SigLIP, UMAP, KMeans, allowing precise clustering based on jersey colours. 

To enable accurate motion analysis, the system will incorporate optical flow to account 
for camera movement and perspective transformation to convert pixel-based distances 
into real-world metrics, such as speed and distance covered. These features will support 
a detailed evaluation of player performance. 

The system will also include tactical visualizations, such as top-down projections, to 
represent player movement patterns and team formations. A Streamlit-based web 
application will allow users to upload football videos and perform analyses through an 
intuitive interface. 

By integrating cutting-edge technologies, this project aspires to offer a practical and 
robust solution for football analytics, serving as a valuable tool for enthusiasts and 
professionals in sports analytics.
