# Football-Analytics-with-Computer-Vision

Taking inspiration from Abdullah Tarek's 'Code In a Jiffy' YouTube channel, I aim to develop a football analytics system that combines advanced AI, computer vision, and deep learning techniques to provide actionable insights into player movement and match dynamics. YOLO, a state-of-the-art object detection model, detects and tracks players, referees, and footballs in video footage. The model is fine-tuned on custom datasets to enhance accuracy. Players are classified into teams through embedding analysis techniques like SigLIP, UMAP, and KMeans, enabling precise clustering based on jersey colors.

To enable accurate motion analysis, the system incorporates optical flow to account for camera movement and perspective transformation to convert pixel-based distances into real-world metrics, such as speed and distance covered. These features support a detailed evaluation of player performance.

The system also includes tactical visualizations, such as top-down projections, to represent player movement patterns and team formations. A Streamlit-based web application allows users to upload football videos and perform analyses through an intuitive interface.

By integrating cutting-edge technologies, this project offers a practical and robust solution for football analytics, serving as a valuable tool for enthusiasts and professionals in sports analytics.

I am actively working on modifying the system and aim to release the updated version as soon as possible.
